# Computer Guardian 


Computer Guardian is an all-in-one platform designed to simplify the process of building custom computers, offering tech guides, and providing the latest news in the world of technology. Our website not only helps users create their perfect PC, but also serves as a hub for the latest advancements in computer hardware and software.

One of the unique features of Computer Guardian is its collaboration with five real-life stores across Egypt, each specializing in computer components. Rather than forcing users to jump between multiple websites to find the specific parts they need, Computer Guardian integrates all available parts from these stores into one centralized platform. This seamless integration allows users to quickly find and purchase parts like graphic cards, processors, and more, all in one place.

## How it Works:
- Search for Parts: Users browse the website for the specific components they need to build or upgrade their computer.
- Collaborative Stores: When a part is requested, the website automatically checks with the partnering stores to verify availability.
- Order Confirmation: If the requested part is available, the store confirms the order directly through the platform.
- Delivery Anywhere in Egypt: A dedicated delivery team collects the part from the store and delivers it to the userâ€™s location, no matter where they are in Egypt.


This process saves users from the hassle of visiting multiple websites and ensures that they can get the part they need efficiently and reliably. Both the stores and the website creators earn a percentage from every sale, making this collaboration beneficial for all parties involved.

At Computer Guardian, we strive to make computer building as easy and accessible as possible, bringing all the essential components and information into one unified experience.
